# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: GreatVibes
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/GreatVibesRegular.ttf

    - family: KBFunHouse
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/KBFunHouse.ttf
    
    - family: Parisienne
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/ParisienneRegular.ttf

    - family: Inconsolata_UltraCondensed-Light
      fonts:
